After 7 days:
  The starting numbers will recur/be exacatly the same as at start
  Any new fish will have a value 2 greater than the value of the fish that spawned it
  Only fish with a start value of 8 will not spawn a new fish after 7 days.

So every 7 day period the following needs to happen:
  Fish with a start value of 8 need to be assigned to value 1
  Fish with start value of 7 need to be assigned t value 0 and a new fish value 8 spawned
  All other start fish values are left the same
  New fish must be created with a value of 2 greater than each of the starting fish

So in a 7 day period the number of fish (without value 8) doubles
