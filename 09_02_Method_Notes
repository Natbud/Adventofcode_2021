Finding Basin Size:

GET FIRST ROW SIZE:
1. Start at low point co-ordinates
2. Count current number (basin_size +1)
3. for/loop to the right, if number is less than 9 then basin_size_+1, else stop.

4. New nested for/loop here going down (and then up!) from each digit arrived in point 3 until hit 9 (adding to basin size), then stop and return to previous loop.

5. Back to start point and do point 3 again but move left this time (again including the nested loops these will be exactly the same as before)

By this point basin_size will be at the value of the size of the basin at that location.


6. Repeat above for every low point found.
