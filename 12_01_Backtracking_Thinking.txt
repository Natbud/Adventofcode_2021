Backtracking Thoughts:

Once a path has reached 'END' following needs to happen:

0. The path found needs to be 'counted' or saved.
1. 'end' needs popped off the visit list and previous node reinitiated as the
  new current node.
2. As 'end' has already been used it's NOT allowed to be used immediately
  so as not to duplicate found path - but can be visited thereafter for any new path.


Once a path has reached a dead end leaf node (but NOT 'END') the following needs to happen:

0. do not save or count the found path as it was a dead end.
1. leaf node needs to be popped off the visit list and previous node reinitiated as new
  current node.
2. Leaf node should just be permenantly 'blocked' / left on the visit list as there's no point having any
  more paths terminating there.
