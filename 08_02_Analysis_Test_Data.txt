Digits and number of segments for each / unique identifier:

0 - 6
1 - 2

Now find non-unique ones:

digit - segments - corresponding 'positions'

RULES (need to be checked in order to succeed):

3) Any word with one of the same letters missing as digit 3 had missing = digit 9
4) Any word with a different letter missing than the missing letter in 6 and 9 = digit 0

2,5,3 (all 5 letters)
